## Features

### 1. **Bot-Blocking Mechanism**
Aurelips has a built-in function to detect and block bots that attempt to buy excessive quantities of the token, only to sell them quickly at the expense of other traders. This function ensures that only legitimate users can interact with the token, making it more secure for the entire community.

### 2. **Flash Minting**
Aurelips features an integrated **flash minting function**, allowing for temporary minting of tokens under certain conditions. This function is primarily used for specific contract interactions or liquidity management. Flash minting enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the token's ecosystem.

### 3. **1 Billion Token Supply**
Aurelips has a fixed total supply of **1 billion** tokens, ensuring scarcity while maintaining a reasonable distribution for community growth, partnerships, and liquidity pools. The fixed supply creates stability and prevents overinflation.

### 4. **Security & Fair Trading**
Aurelips is designed with the goal of creating a safe and fair environment for all users. The bot-blocking function reduces price manipulation by preventing automated systems from unfairly driving prices. Additionally, the token is coded to prevent large sudden sell-offs, helping maintain price stability over time.

## Security Features

Aurelips comes equipped with advanced security measures to protect users from malicious activities. The key features include:

1. **Bot Detection & Prevention:** Any attempt by bots to purchase large amounts of Aurelips tokens within a short time frame is automatically flagged and blocked, preventing large-scale pump-and-dump schemes.
   
2. **Anti-Sniping & Anti-Front Running:** The token contract uses advanced techniques to prevent sniping bots and other front-running tactics during the token sale or liquidity events.

3. **Anti-Whale Protection:** The bot-blocking function ensures that no single entity or bot can dominate the supply or manipulate the market.

## Renouncement of Ownership

Once **Aurelips** gains traction in the market and establishes a strong, decentralized community, the developer will **renounce ownership** of the contract, ensuring full decentralization. This move demonstrates the commitment to fairness, transparency, and community-driven governance.
